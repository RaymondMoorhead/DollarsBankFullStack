The back-end web application of this full-stack project is written in Java, using the [**Spring**](https://spring.io/) framework. [**Eclipse**](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) is the IDE in use for development but [**IntelliJ**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) should work too.

Spring's CrudRepository is utilized to establish a connection with an SQL server, which is accessed through services and controllers which make up the API for the front-end. A basic hash and jumble encryption is also applied to Customers' passwords for security.

2. Start your local MySQL service and change the `username` and `password` in the `application.properties` if needed
3. Create a `dollars_bank` database in your MySQL local server.
4. Run the application in your IDE which should run on [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) by default.
